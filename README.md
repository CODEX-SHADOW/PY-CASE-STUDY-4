Case Study 4: Web Scraping and Data Visualization
Write a Python program to scrape data from a website (e.g., stock market data or weather information) using libraries like Beautiful Soup and Requests. Once you've collected the data, use Python libraries like Matplotlib or Seaborn to visualize the information. This case study combines data retrieval, data processing, and data visualization using Python.
 code performs web scraping of COVID-19 data from the URL 'https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/countries-where-coronavirus-has-spread/' using the requests and BeautifulSoup libraries to extract information about the number of cases, deaths, countries, and continents affected by the coronavirus.

Let's break down the code into sections:

Scraping Data (scrap_data() function):

The scrap_data() function utilizes requests to fetch the HTML content of the specified URL.
It then uses BeautifulSoup to parse the HTML content.
The function iterates through the HTML elements (<td>) to extract data related to countries, confirmed cases, deaths, and continents affected by COVID-19.
It removes commas from the numbers (for confirmed cases and deaths) and stores the data in a list of tuples (data), which is returned at the end of the function.
Processing Data:

The collected data is then converted into a Pandas DataFrame (df).
The DataFrame is sorted based on the number of cases in descending order (df.sort_values()).
A new column Death_rate is calculated, representing the percentage of deaths in relation to the number of cases in each country.
Visualization using Seaborn and Matplotlib:

Several Seaborn and Matplotlib visualization methods are used to display various aspects of the COVID-19 data:
sns.pairplot: Pairplot for visualizing pairwise relationships across different continents.
sns.barplot: Bar plot displaying the number of cases by country for the top 10 countries.
sns.regplot: Regression plot showing the relationship between deaths and the number of cases.
sns.scatterplot: Scatterplot representing the number of cases vs. deaths, colored by continent.
sns.boxplot: Boxplot displaying deaths by country for the top 10 countries, colored by continent.
sns.barplot (again): Barplot displaying the death rate by continent.
Data Presentation:

Lastly, the script uses the texttable library to present the collected data as a text table using table.draw().
Additionally, there's a redundant sns.pairplot() command near the end of the code just before plt.show(), which replicates the pairplot visualization that's already been plotted earlier in the code.

The plt.show() function is used to display the Matplotlib and Seaborn plots generated by the code. However, due to the placement of the plt.show() command, only the last generated plot (the redundant sns.pairplot) will be displayed when running the script. If you want to display specific plots, you may want to use plt.show() after each specific plot command.
